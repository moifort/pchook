# Backend Architecture

## Overview

The backend follows a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture built on [Nitro](https://nitro.build/) with TypeScript, file-based storage, and branded types.

## Theoretical Foundations

This architecture draws from two foundational DDD books:

- **Eric Evans** — *Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software* (2003)
- **Scott Wlashin** — *Domain Modeling Made Functional: Tackle Software Complexity with Domain-Driven Design and F#* (2018)

**Evans concepts used in this project:**

| Concept | Where |
|---------|-------|
| Bounded Context | Each `server/domain/{domain}/` is a self-contained context with clear boundaries |
| Ubiquitous Language | Function and type names carry business meaning, not technical jargon |
| Value Objects | Branded types in `types.ts` — identity through value, not reference |
| Entities | Domain types with an `id` field in `types.ts` |
| Repository | `repository.ts` — abstracts storage, private to the bounded context |
| Application Services | `query.ts`, `command.ts`, `use-case.ts` — orchestrate domain operations |
| Anti-Corruption Layer | Zod validation at domain boundaries prevents invalid data from entering |

**Wlashin concepts used in this project:**

| Concept | Where |
|---------|-------|
| Making illegal states unrepresentable | Branded types + Zod constructors in `primitives.ts` |
| Railway-Oriented Programming | Discriminated union returns in commands — reserved for expected business outcomes only, not technical errors. `throw` for impossible states. |
| Types as documentation | Branded types make the domain model self-documenting |
| Pure domain functions | `business-rules.ts` — no IO, no async, pure input/output |

## Layers

### Domain Layer (`server/domain/`)

Each domain is a self-contained bounded context:

- **types.ts** — Branded types using `ts-brand`. Evans: Value Objects (identity through value) and Entities (types with an `id`).
- **primitives.ts** — Zod constructors that validate and brand raw values. Wlashin: making illegal states unrepresentable — if it parses, it's valid.
- **repository.ts** — File-based storage access (private, never imported from outside the domain). Evans: Repository pattern — abstracts persistence behind a domain-oriented interface.
- **query.ts** — Public read operations (exported namespace). Evans: the public contract of the bounded context.
- **command.ts** — Public write operations (exported namespace). Evans: Application Service — orchestrates domain logic and exposes it to the outside.
- **use-case.ts** — (optional) Multi-domain orchestrations. Names carry business intent (`addWithTasting`, not `handleCreate`). No direct storage access. Evans: Application Service coordinating multiple bounded contexts.
- **business-rules.ts** — (optional) Pure functions (no IO, no async). Function names ARE the business concept (`wineStatus`, not `computeWineStatus`). 100% test coverage required. Wlashin: pure domain functions — all logic is testable without infrastructure.

### Read Model Layer (`server/read-model/`)

Composite views that assemble data from multiple domains for display needs. Mirrors the `domain/` structure. Only imports public Query/Command namespaces — never repositories directly.

Read models answer questions like "what does the wine list look like with ratings and contacts?" or "what's the dashboard overview?". They exist because these views span multiple bounded contexts.

> This is the Query Model / read side of CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation). Commands and queries have different data shapes and access patterns — read models optimize for display without polluting domain logic.

### GraphQL Layer (`server/graphql/`)

Code-first GraphQL API using Apollo Server + Pothos. Cohabits with REST routes — both `/graphql` and REST endpoints are available simultaneously.

- **Types** reference domain types as Pothos backing models — no type duplication
- **Queries** delegate to read models and domain queries (same as REST routes)
- **Mutations** delegate to domain commands and use-cases (same as REST routes)
- **Nested resolvers** on object types (e.g. `Book.review`, `Book.series`) allow clients to request only the data they need
- **Schema SDL** exported to `shared/schema.graphql` for Apollo iOS codegen
- **Apollo Sandbox** available in dev at `/graphql` for schema exploration and query building

### Route Layer (`server/routes/`)

HTTP handlers that validate input at the boundary, call domain queries/commands (or use cases/read models), and return responses. Includes the `/graphql` endpoint for Apollo Server.

### System Layer (`server/system/`)

Infrastructure concerns: config, migration, Sentry instrumentation, request caching.

## Cross-Domain Rules

1. **Repositories are private** — A repository can only be used within its own domain (`command.ts`, `query.ts`). Other domains access data through public `Query` namespaces. Evans: Bounded Context integrity — each context owns its data and protects its invariants.
2. **Validation at domain boundary** — All data entering a domain is validated/branded. No re-validation internally. Evans: Anti-Corruption Layer — foreign data is translated into domain types at the boundary.
3. **No domain-to-domain imports** — Domains communicate through their public Query/Command namespaces, never by importing each other's repositories or types directly. Evans: contexts communicate through well-defined public interfaces, never by reaching into each other's internals.

## Data Flow

**Simple operation (single domain):**
```
HTTP Request → route → domain command/query → repository → Response
```

**Orchestrated operation (multi-domain):**
```
HTTP Request → route → use-case → multiple commands/queries → Response
```

**Composite read (cross-domain view):**
```
HTTP Request → route → read-model → multiple domain queries → Response
```

**GraphQL query (with nested resolvers):**
```
GraphQL Request → /graphql → Apollo Server → Pothos resolver → domain query/read-model → Response
                                           → nested resolver → domain query → merged into Response
```

**GraphQL mutation:**
```
GraphQL Request → /graphql → Apollo Server → Pothos resolver → domain command/use-case → Response
```

## Storage

File-based storage via Nitro's `useStorage()`. Each domain gets its own namespace configured in `nitro.config.ts`:

```ts
storage: {
  'migration-meta': { driver: 'fs', base: './.data/db/migration-meta' },
  example: { driver: 'fs', base: './.data/db/example' },
}
```

## Sentry Integration

- Domain commands and queries are auto-instrumented with Sentry tracing
- Storage operations are wrapped with spans (including `cache.hit` attribute)
- HTTP requests get server spans with route name normalization
- Errors (5xx only) are captured automatically

## Logging

Structured logging via [consola](https://github.com/unjs/consola) (transitive dependency of Nitro). Each module creates a tagged logger:

```ts
import { createLogger } from '~/system/logger'

const log = createLogger('my-tag')

log.info('Something happened', { details })
log.error('Something failed')
```

The factory is in `server/system/logger.ts`. Tags appear in log output for easy filtering.
